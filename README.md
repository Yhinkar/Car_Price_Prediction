# Car_Price_Prediction
There is an automobile company XYZ from Germany which allows people to sell their cars on their website (just like OLX).
 
They want to help the customers to set a baseline price based on the features of the car a customer wants to sell on their website.
However, this project doesn't deal with the deployment part, but only simulate how the prediction works in production.


Objectives:
As a Machine Learning engineer or Data scientist you are required to apply some data science techniques to predict the price of cars with the available independent variables. 
That should help Customers to understand what price they can sell their cars. 

Dataset and Python code:
You can download the python code from my Github.

The solution is divided into the following sections:
Data understanding and exploration
Data cleaning
Validation Framework
Model Implementation and evaluation
Regularization and tuning
Model usage.

Conclusion..
The model predicted closer to the price of a car. However, the final predictors 
still seem to have high correlations. One can go ahead and remove some of these features (though it will affect the r2 score, but try to do that)
You can also try to add more relevant features that will tends to improve the model prediction.
